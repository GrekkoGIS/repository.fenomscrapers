    to "ON".[/I]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Torrentz2 new domain and back to working again.

    on results page so the scraper has also been
    converted to pack capable.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added torrent specific Help info to the "Torrents"
    category in Settings.  This lists what torrents are api
    requests, single html parsed, and two request html
    parsed(slow). Also lists which scrapers use cfscrape module.[/I]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] YTS scraper has been re-written to utilize the yts.mx api.
    the query uses the imdb_id so results are now more
    accurate than before.  File size is also returned in the
    api response that we did not have site wide before.[/I]
[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Torrentz2 and Solidtorrents has been down for a few days
    now so their default has been switched to "false".[/I]

[COLOR yellow]--[/COLOR][I] Added a new filter to all scrapers for query results when
    a movie title exists and a show with same tile and year
    also exists.  The new filter will now check Movie results
    for season info and remove those results.  A perfect
    example is the movie "Run (2020)" a show also exists
    with the same title and previously returned results.
    The new filter will now remove those show results.[/I]
